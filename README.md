## Description

Energy Ball Synchronization is a creative and interactive desktop application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to create and manipulate multiple floating energy balls, each rendered in a distinct color. The application features a unique synchronization mechanism where the energy balls, displayed in separate windows, dynamically connect and interact with each other based on their positions.

## Installation

To use the Energy Ball Synchronization, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the source code for the Energy Ball Synchronization from this repository.
3. Navigate to the downloaded directory.

## Usage

To run the application, execute the script from your command line:

```bash
python energy_ball_synchronization.py
```

## Once the application is running:
1. Launch the application to open the control panel.
2. Use the 'Create new ball' button to generate new energy ball windows.
3. Click the 'Delete last ball' button to remove the most recently created energy ball.
4. Drag the energy ball windows around the screen to see real-time connection lines between them.
5. The application supports up to 5 energy balls at a time.

## Features
1. Generate up to 5 interactive energy ball windows.
2. Real-time synchronization and connection lines between energy balls.
3. Draggable windows with dynamic positioning.
4. Control panel for easy management of energy balls.
5. Attractive color scheme for each energy ball.
